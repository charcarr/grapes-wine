Shiny wine is an interactive shiny app designed for beginner sommeliers and/or wine enthusiasts. The app aims to showcase characteristics of the 7 noble grapes based on data rather than literature. 

* Chardonnay
* Sauvignon Blanc
* Riesling
* Cabernet Sauvignon
* Merlot
* Pinot Noir
* Syrah / Shiraz

<br/>

## The data

This app was constructed using a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data) containing 130,000 different sommelier reviewed wines.

<br/>

## Why?

This app visualizes information regarding each varietal's characteristic 

* flavour profile,
* growing regions and, 
* price-quality correlations 

in a manner that is hopefully more engaging than a textbook. 

Inspired by HTM*4050, a Wine and Oenology [class](https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2017-2018/courses/htm4050.shtml) at the University of Guelph.
